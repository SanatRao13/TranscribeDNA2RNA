# Transcribe DNA 2 RNA
Uses user input of a DNA sequence and translates into its RNA equivalent. DNA uses the base nucleic acids Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine. Meanwhile, RNA uses the base nucleic acids Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Uracil (Uracil is more unstable than Thymine, but the temporary nature of RNA means that there is no necessity for Thymine in RNA. Additionally, Thymine requires more energy to put together). These bases are represented as AGCT for DNA (respectively) and AGCU for RNA (respectively). This program converts the AGCT from DNA to the AGCU for RNA.
